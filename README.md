# Hello-World
repository to help my learning process

I'm leaning coding to get into web development, at the moment I feel comfortable with the principles of HTML and very close to the same with CSS. JavaScript still needs alot of work for me. I have a gret interest and aim to be working in Budapest by half-way through this year.
